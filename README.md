### SUMMARY:
We at TuneIn hope this simple web app can help relieve "earworm" type symptoms by providing song lyrics, a music video provided by YouTube, and artist related upcoming events.

This particular website utilizes third party API's to present artist and song data to the user. Once a song title and Artist is submitted, results will be generated.

User inputs the song title and artist of the song into the search form to generate data relating to the desired song. The user will see a thumbnail of the song provided by Google Search API. Upon clicking the the thumbnail, the user is taken to YouTube hosted music 'video'. Furthermore, users will be able to see lyrics and the next three upcoming concert events for the related artist and song. 

Studies suggest that when a person has a catchy tune or song stuck in their head, symptoms may be relieved by listening to the entirety of the song again. Information based around these studies can be found on the About page which is found by clicking the link in the navigation bar.
