			<h3>The Science Behind It</h3>
			<p>Researchers found partial support for the theory that earworms occur as a result of the Zeigarnik Effect, in which our minds get stuck on incomplete mental processes. This theory suggests that our brains can get "hung up," when we hear an incomplete song that we do not know well. Because our mind can’t “put the song away” and finish it, it gets stuck like a needle on a record, or as in "Groundhog Day," playing the same unfinished snippet on nonstop repeat. In the 2012 research, both complete and incomplete songs created earworms—and people who were more musically talented were more prone to develop earworms.</p>
